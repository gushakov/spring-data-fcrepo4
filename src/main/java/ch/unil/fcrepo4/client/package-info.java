/**
 * This package provides SPI for communicating with Fedora repository using {@code fcrepo-java-client} API. Its based on
 * the implementation from {@code org.fcrepo.client} from the deprecated <a href="https://github.com/fcrepo4-labs/fcrepo4-client">fcrepo4-client</a>
 * project. <br/> Also, some code has been modeled on the unit and integration tests from <a
 * href="https://github.com/fcrepo4-exts/fcrepo-java-client">fcrepo-java-client</a> project.
